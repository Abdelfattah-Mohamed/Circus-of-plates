# Circus-of-plates

It is single player-game in which each clown carries two stacks of plates, and there are a
set of coloured plates queues that fall and he tries to catch them if he manages to collect
three consecutive plates of the same colour, then they have vanished and his score
increases. You are free to put rules ending the game.
